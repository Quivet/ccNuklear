<p align="center"> Intro </p>

<hr/>

<p> This is a program I wrote to control my mekanism fission reactor so it wouldn't meltdown </p>

<h3> List of features </h3>

<ul>
  <li>Monitor reactor</li>
  <li>Monitor turbine</li>
  <li>Monitor induction matrix</li>
  <li>Scram in case of problem</li>
</ul>


<h3> Download & Installation </h3>

Attach a computer to a turbine vent and a fission logic control adaptor directly or via wired modem (don't forget to right-click the wired modem).

<h3>Contributing</h3>
Keep it simple. Keep it minimal. Don't put every single feature just because you can.
